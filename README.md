## Agnoster Refresh Timestamp NewLine
This is a modification for the Agnoster Refresh theme with inspiration from [@DylanDelobel's](https://github.com/DylanDelobel) [agnoster-timestamp-newline-zsh-theme](https://github.com/DylanDelobel/agnoster-timestamp-newline-zsh-theme)
I am not a particular good Z shell (or any particular shell) coder, so my work was mainly joining this two inspirarions.
I wanted the new refreshed look for agnoster but had been using @DylanDelobel's version for years, that is why i forked Agnoster Refresh theme and did this mashup.

Pleae visit both projects for proper credits.
